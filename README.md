## Sports Training Monitoring System

### Introduction
We have developed a system that allows a coach to monitor the sports achievements of their trainees in both strength and cardio training sessions.

## Description
**Application purpose:**
- The application is designed for managing workouts.

**Main panel functionalities:**
- Adding and removing users,
- Displaying user information such as BMI,
- Saving workout information,
- Viewing workout history,
- Alphabetically sorting users,
- Displaying user rankings.
  - The ranking is based on TotalScore, which is the sum of all points received by the trainee for exercises.
  - After completing an exercise, the trainee receives points. In the case of strength training, the number of points depends on the weight load, sets, and repetitions. For cardio training, points are calculated based on distance, time, and calories burned.

**The application allows logging into an account.**
